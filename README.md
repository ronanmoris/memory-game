## Instructions

*   Click on a card to start the game
*   Try to match the symbols

## Rating

The three stars on top of the deck are the players rating based on how many moves he/she needs to complete the challenge. The more stars the player keeps until the end the better.

The timer will start as soon as the player clicks the first card. The faster the player finishes the game the better!
